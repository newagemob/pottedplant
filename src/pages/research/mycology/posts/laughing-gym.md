As I wandered deep into the forest, somewhere between California and Canada, I was on the hunt for slugs to photograph. I had heard rumors of a particular species that was native to the area and I was determined to track it down - the Reticulate Taildropper, a type of slug that is known for its unique, colorful appearance and its ability to amputate its own tail when threatened.

But as I tramped through the underbrush, I came across something unexpected: a patch of laughing gym mushrooms, growing wild and free. I had heard of these rare fungi before, but I had never actually encountered them in the wild.

Laughing gym mushrooms, also known as Gymnopilus junonius, are a type of psilocybin mushroom that are native to North America. They were first discovered in the late 1950s by mycologist R. Gordon Wasson, who was studying the use of psychoactive mushrooms in indigenous cultures.

I was immediately struck by the differences between the laughing gym mushrooms and the more common liberty caps I had encountered in the past. For one, the laughing gyms were much larger, with caps that were almost twice the size of the liberty caps. They also had a more vibrant, colorful appearance, with bright yellow and orange hues that seemed to glow in the sunlight.

But perhaps the most striking difference was the way they smelled. The liberty caps had a strong, earthy aroma that reminded me of the forest floor, but the laughing gyms had a much more pleasant, floral scent that reminded me of a spring meadow on a warm summer day, laying on my back when I should be doing something productive. I started to wonder if the mushrooms themselves were somehow connected to the slugs I was looking for, and if they were somehow related to the Reticulate Taildropper.
