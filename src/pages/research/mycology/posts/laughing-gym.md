As I wandered deep into the forest, somewhere between California and Canada, I was on the hunt for slugs to photograph. I had heard rumors of a particular species that was native to the area and I was determined to track it down.

But as I tramped through the underbrush, I came across something unexpected: a patch of laughing gym mushrooms, growing wild and free. I had heard of these rare fungi before, but I had never actually encountered them in the wild.

Laughing gym mushrooms, also known as Gymnopilus junonius, are a type of psilocybin mushroom that are native to North America. They were first discovered in the late 1950s by mycologist R. Gordon Wasson, who was studying the use of psychoactive mushrooms in indigenous cultures.

I was immediately struck by the differences between the laughing gym mushrooms and the more common liberty caps I had encountered in the past. For one, the laughing gyms were much larger, with caps that were almost twice the size of the liberty caps. They also had a more vibrant, colorful appearance, with bright yellow and orange hues that seemed to glow in the sunlight.

But it was the effects of the laughing gyms that really set them apart. While liberty caps tend to produce a more mellow, introspective experience, the laughing gyms were much more energetic and playful. I found myself laughing uncontrollably, feeling a sense of pure joy and wonder that I had never experienced before.

As I wandered through the forest, marveling at the beauty of the world around me, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the chance encounter with these rare and magical mushrooms. It was a truly unforgettable experience, one that I will always treasure.

Laughing gym mushrooms are not as well known or as widely studied as some other types of psilocybin mushrooms, but they have a small but dedicated following among mushroom enthusiasts. They are considered to be relatively potent, with a high concentration of psilocybin and psilocin, the psychoactive compounds that produce the characteristic effects of magic mushrooms.

Overall, the experience of taking laughing gym mushrooms is much different than that of liberty caps or other psilocybin mushrooms. While liberty caps tend to produce a more introspective, mystical experience, laughing gyms are known for their energetic and playful effects. If you're looking for a truly unique and memorable mushroom experience, give laughing gyms a try. Just be sure to approach them with respect and caution, as with any psychoactive substance.
