# Just Some Prompts

I wanted to share some prompts that gave me incredible results with GPTChat. I'm sure they could be tweaked to be even better, but I'm happy with the results I've gotten so far.

## Stock Market Data Scripts

create a python script using yfinance, pandas, xlsxwriter, and any other packages needed to get a list of all S&P 500 stocks, updating an excel spreadsheet every fifteen minutes, recording a history and outputting the data in a csv with the top 100 stocks, a graph of the current top 10 performers, and create a python script using yfinance, pandas, xlsxwriter, and any other packages needed to get a list of all S&P 500 stocks, updating an excel spreadsheet every fifteen minutes, recording a history and outputting the data in a version-control-type csv matrix with the top 100 stocks, a graph of the current top 10 performers, and a graph of the current top 10 losers.
