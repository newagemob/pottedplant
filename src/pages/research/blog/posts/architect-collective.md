# Architecture

## Introduction

When I was a kid I thought Frank Lloyd Wright was a just a funny Simon and Garfunkel song. When I got older I saw a lot of *entertainers* taking up architecture and had a sort of psychedelic revelation, seeing the world in a new way. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a building, and I wanted to be an architect. I was also fascinated by the idea of designing a computer, and I wanted to be a computer scientist. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a car, and I wanted to be an automotive engineer. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a plane, and I wanted to be a pilot. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a boat, and I wanted to be a sailor. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a house, and I wanted to be an electrician. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a city, and I wanted to be a city planner. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a country, and I wanted to be a politician. I was fascinated by the idea of designing a planet, and I wanted to be a god.

## The Architect

It seems we're here to create. And while we may not be able to do it all ourselves, we can at least do some of it together. Perhaps we are the architect together, this consciousness that seems to overlap might be unified soil and herb separted into pots of being, having the choice to grow towards one another or drift to our own desires.

I've never been able to articulate exactly how I feel about this, and I think it would most closely relate to ***[Panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism)***, even though I have my differences of opinion with that theology. Nonetheless, the stream of consciousness is a compelling thought, and I used to try to think about each person being a cup that's been filled from that stream. But water doesn't grow of course. A potted plant suits the analogy far better, with it's multiple parts and care required to ensure it lives and flourishes. Plus water doesn't die when it gets lonely.
