***Developer Studio | Isaiah Wright's Personal Portfolio***

## About

This website doubles as a personal portfolio for Isaiah Wright and a business portfolio for the [Potted Plant](https://pottedplant.dev) developer studio. I'm a full-stack developer and designer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and accessible applications. I'm currently working on a few projects, including a new portfolio website for myself and a new website for the Potted Plant studio.

It is built with **[t3](https://create.t3.gg/)**, using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the database, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend, and half [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) / half [Potted Plant's own CSS framework]() for styling.

## What is Potted Plant?

Potted Plant is a developer studio started in 2022. It's a place to create, learn, and grow. This is where my ideas grow and are filtered.
